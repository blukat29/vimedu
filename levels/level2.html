<p>Vim's third mode is the visual mode. In visual mode,
you can select texts and manipulate them. Just as you
would do by dragging mouse in Notepad or Word.</p>

<p>Press <kbd>v</kbd> to start selecting.<br>Then move around with
<kbd>→</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd><kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>→</kbd>To extend your selection.</p>

<p>Press <kbd>d</kbd> to delete the selection.</p>

<p>If something goes wrong, press <kbd>u</kbd> to undo the changes.</p>

<p>Task: delete all the 'x' in the screen and press <kbd>:w</kbd> to go to next level.</p>
